# Parking_Lot_Sensor
By Patrick Webb, Vahagn Tovmasian

Final Project for EE128 Fall 2022 with Dr. Roman Chomko.

							
## Project Description: 
The goal of this device is to monitor multiple parking spots and to display which spots are available with LED. The LED corresponding to the nearest available parking spot will blink as an indication to the user. The project uses one way RF communication from the sensors to the main hub so that parking lot infrastructure would not have to be rebuilt, and can easily be repurposed to be used in any sort of motion detection application.

The motivation for this project is that Parking Lot sensing technology is often costly to implement depending on the shape of the parking lot, number of spots, and/or the cost of renovating the infrastructure. A camera device has a limited field of view that works best in large open spaces, however magnetic sensing requires a significant upfront investment to rebuild the lot.
